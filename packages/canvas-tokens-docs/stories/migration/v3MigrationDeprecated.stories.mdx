# Base Deprecated Tokens

Many color tokens from previous versions have been deprecated or replaced in v3 to align with the
new color system and improve consistency, accessibility, and brand alignment. Deprecated tokens are
mapped to new palette values or system tokens where possible. When migrating, review the table below
to find the recommended replacements for each deprecated token.

Note that the new color values may not be exact visual matches due to the switch to the OKLCH color
space and the expanded palette scale. We recommend updating your usage to the system tokens for the
best results and future compatibility.
