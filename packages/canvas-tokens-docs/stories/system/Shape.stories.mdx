# System Shape Tokens

System shape tokens provide consistent shapes across our UI. They're used in our buttons, labels,
cards, and more.

## Usage

Shape tokens can be consumed as a JavaScript / TypeScript object. Each token value references the
CSS variable from a base token, so you'll need to have those CSS variables imported in your
application as well.

```ts
// styles.ts
import {system} from '@workday/canvas-tokens-web';

const styles = {
  borderRadius: `var(${system.shape.x2})`,
};
```

They can also be consumed as CSS, Sass, or Less variables. In the example below, we're applying the
same styles using CSS variables directly.

```css
// styles.css
.card {
  border-radius: var(--cnvs-sys-shape-x2);
}
```

---

## Tokens

These tokens use a multiplier scale and reference our `baseUnit` token, which is `0.25rem` / `4px`.
So the `system.shape.x2` token has a value of `0.5rem` or `8px`.

## Deprecated Tokens

The following shape tokens have been deprecated in v4. Each deprecated token now points to a new token value. The deprecated tokens will continue to work but will resolve to their replacement values. We recommend updating your code to use the new token names directly.
