# System Tokens

System tokens are **themed variables** intended to provide application-wide theming. They are not
connected to brand tokens, which are tenant-specific.

## Usage

System tokens can be consumed as a JavaScript / TypeScript object. Each token value references the
CSS variable from a base token, so you'll need to have those CSS variables imported in your
application as well. This is discussed further in the
[Getting Started guide](/docs/docs-getting-started--docs). Unlike JavaScript variables, CSS custom
properties (variables) need to be wrapped in `var()` to be valid. If you're new to CSS variables, it
might take a bit for that to feel intuitive.

> In the example below, we're importing CSS variables in the file directly for clarity. But you'll
> likely want to do this at the top-level of your application to avoid redundancy and
> unintentionally overwriting values.

```ts
// styles.ts
import '@workday/canvas-tokens-web/css/base/_variables.css';
import '@workday/canvas-tokens-web/css/system/_variables.css';
import {system} from '@workday/canvas-tokens-web';

const styles = {
  boxShadow: `var(${system.depth[2]})`,
  padding: `var(${system.space.x4})`,
};
```

They can also be consumed as CSS, Sass, or Less variables. In the example below, we're applying the
same styles using CSS variables directly.

```css
// styles.css
@import '@workday/canvas-tokens-web/css/base/_variables.css';
@import '@workday/canvas-tokens-web/css/system/_variables.css';

.card {
  background-color: var(--cnvs-sys-depth-2);
  padding: var(--cnvs-sys-space-x4);
}
```

## Tokens

There are several token collections within system tokens. You can find more documentation on them at
