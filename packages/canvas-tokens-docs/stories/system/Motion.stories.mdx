# System Motion Tokens

Currently, only easing tokens are available at the system token level. For motion usage guidelines, including information on how to choose an appropriate easing value, see the [Canvas Motion Documentation](https://canvas.workday.com/styles/tokens/motion).

## Easing Tokens

System easing tokens provide standardized cubic-bezier curves for animations and transitions across our UI.

### Usage

Easing tokens can be consumed as a JavaScript / TypeScript object. Each token value references the
CSS variable from a base token, so you'll need to have those CSS variables imported in your
application as well.

```ts
// styles.ts
import {system} from '@workday/canvas-tokens-web';

const styles = {
  transition: `transform 300ms var(${system.motion.easing.quick.standard})`,
};
```

They can also be consumed as CSS, Sass, or Less variables. In the example below, we're applying the
same styles using CSS variables directly.

```css
// styles.css
.button {
  transition: transform 300ms var(--cnvs-sys-easing-quick-standard);
}
```

### Categories

System easing tokens are organized into two categories:

- **Quick** - For shorter, faster interactions (hover states, button presses, etc.)
- **Purposeful** - For longer, more meaningful transitions (modals, panels, page transitions)

Each category includes three timing function variants:
- **Standard** - Balanced easing for general use
- **Acceleration** - Emphasizes the beginning of the animation
- **Deceleration** - Emphasizes the end of the animation
