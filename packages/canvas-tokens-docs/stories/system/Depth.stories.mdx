# System Depth Tokens

System depth tokens use box shadows to help users understand the spacial relationship of objects in
our UI.

## Usage

Depth tokens can be consumed as a JavaScript / TypeScript object. Each token value references the
CSS variable from a base token, so you'll need to have those CSS variables imported in your
application as well.

```ts
// styles.ts
import {system} from '@workday/canvas-tokens-web';

const styles = {
  boxShadow: `var(${system.depth[2]})`,
};
```

They can also be consumed as CSS, Sass, or Less variables. In the example below, we're applying the
same styles using CSS variables directly.

```css
// styles.css
.card {
  box-shadow: var(--cnvs-sys-depth-2);
}
```

---

## Tokens

These tokens use a linear step scale (1-6). As the steps increase, the shadows become larger and
more pronounced. Use more subtle shadows for components closer to the base level, and more
pronounced shadows for components further away.
