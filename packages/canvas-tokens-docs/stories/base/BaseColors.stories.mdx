## Color

Base colors provide the core palettes that make up our UI. There are thirteen palettes in total and
they don't have any inherent contextual meaning on when and where they should be used.

<br />

> **Note:** Consumers should try to avoid using base tokens and instead use system tokens to future-proof theming.

### Deprecated Colors

The fruit based palettes are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use the new
color palette. While the base tokens are deprecated, we advise to use system tokens instead for
better future proofing.
