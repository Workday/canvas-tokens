# Brand Tokens

Brand tokens are **themed variables** designated for brand / tenant-level customization. They are
not connected to system tokens, which are intended to be application-wide. They're used for our
buttons, focus rings, errors, and banners.

## Usage

Brand tokens can be consumed as a JavaScript / TypeScript object. Each token value references the
CSS variable from a base token, so you'll need to have those CSS variables imported in your
application as well. This is discussed further in the
[Getting Started guide](/docs/docs-getting-started--docs). Unlike JavaScript variables, CSS custom
properties (variables) need to be wrapped in `var()` to be valid. If you're new to CSS variables, it
might take a bit for that to feel intuitive.

> In the example below, we're importing CSS variables in the file directly for clarity. But you'll
> likely want to do this at the top-level of your application to avoid redundancy and
> unintentionally overwriting values.

```ts
// styles.ts
import '@workday/canvas-tokens-web/css/base/_variables.css';
import '@workday/canvas-tokens-web/css/brand/_variables.css';
import {brand} from '@workday/canvas-tokens-web';

const styles = {
  backgroundColor: `var(${brand.primary.base})`,
  color: `var(${brand.primary.accent})`,
};
```

They can also be consumed as CSS, Sass, or Less variables. In the example below, we're applying the
same styles using CSS variables directly.

```css
// styles.css
@import '@workday/canvas-tokens-web/css/base/_variables.css';
@import '@workday/canvas-tokens-web/css/brand/_variables.css';

.button {
  background-color: var(--cnvs-brand-primary-base);
  color: var(--cnvs-brand-primary-accent);
}
```

## Colors

Currently, tenant theming is scoped to color.

> **Note:** `--cnvs-brand-action-**` should be used with caution. Defining brand primary colors should cover most of the theming use cases. However, in situations where you want more granular control over actions like `PrimaryButton`, you can define different colors for the action tokens. By Default, the action tokens map to our `--cnvs-brand-primary-**` tokens.
